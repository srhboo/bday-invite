<div class="prompt">// I DON'T GET IT //</div>
I think it would be nice to eat a meal with my friends on my birthday. I'd like us all to put on our funkiest costumes, cook our favourite meal, and stream ourselves eating during the ~eating hour~. We don't even have to talk (but who's to say we can't). Feel free to drop in / out whenever, as you please! And come early / stick around after the meal if you feel like it.
